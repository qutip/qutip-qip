class GateCompiler(object):
    """
    Base class of compilers, including the :meth:`GateCompiler.compile` method.
    It compiles a :class:`.QubitCircuit` into
    the pulse sequence for the processor. The core member function
    `compile` calls compiling method from the sub-class and concatenate
    the compiled pulses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_qubits: int
        The number of the component systems.

    params: dict, optional
        A Python dictionary contains the name and the value of the parameters,
        such as laser frequency, detuning etc.
        It will be saved in the class attributes and can be used to calculate
        the control pulses.

    Attributes
    ----------
    gate_compiler: dict
        The Python dictionary in the form of {gate_name: compiler_function}.
        It saves the compiling routine for each gate. See sub-classes
        for implementation.
        Note that for continuous pulse, the first coeff should always be 0.

    args: dict
        The compilation configurations.
        It will be passed to each compiling functions.
        Available arguments:

        * ``shape``: The compiled pulse shape. ``rectangular`` or
          one of the `SciPy window functions
          <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.windows.html>`_.
        * ``num_samples``:
          Number of samples for continuous pulses.
          It has no effect for rectangular pulses.
        * ``params``: Hardware parameters computed in the :obj:`Processor`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : str
            The name ``"rectangular"`` for constant pulse or
            the name of a Scipy window function.
            See

        num_samples : int
            The number of the samples of the coefficients.
        maximum : float, optional
            The maximum of the coefficients.
            The absolute value will be used if negative.
        area : float, optional
            The total area if one integrates coeff as a function of the time.
            If the area is negative, the pulse is flipped vertically
            (i.e. the pulse is multiplied by the sign of the area).

        Returns
        -------
        coeff, tlist :
            If the default window ``"shape"="rectangular"`` is used,
            both are float numbers.
            If Scipy window functions are used, both are a 1-dimensional numpy
            array with the same size.

        Notes
        -----
        If Scipy window functions are used, it is suggested to set
        ``Processor.pulse_mode`` to ``"continuous"``.
        Notice that finite number of sampling points will also make
        the total integral of the coefficients slightly deviate from ``area``.
