class SpinChainCompiler(GateCompiler):
    """
    Compile a :class:`qutip.QubitCircuit` into
    the pulse sequence for the processor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N: int
        The number of qubits in the system.

    params: dict
        A Python dictionary contains the name and the value of the parameters,
        such as laser frequency, detuning etc.

    setup: string
        "linear" or "circular" for two sub-classes.

    global_phase: bool
        Record of the global phase change and will be returned.

    pulse_dict: dict
        Dictionary of pulse indices.

    Attributes
    ----------
    N: int
        The number of the component systems.

    params: dict
        A Python dictionary contains the name and the value of the parameters,
        such as laser frequency, detuning etc.

    pulse_dict: dict
        Dictionary of pulse indices.

    gate_compiler: dict
        The Python dictionary in the form of {gate_name: decompose_function}.
        It saves the decomposition scheme for each gate.

    setup: string
        "linear" or "circular" for two sub-classes.

    global_phase: bool
        Record of the global phase change and will be returned.
