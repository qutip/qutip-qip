class SpinChainCompiler(GateCompiler):
    """
    Decompose a :class:`qutip.QubitCircuit` into
    the pulse sequence for the processor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N: int
        The number of qubits in the system.

    params: dict
        A Python dictionary contains the name and the value of the parameters,
        such as laser frequency, detuning etc.

    setup: string
        "linear" or "circular" for two sub-calsses.

    global_phase: bool
        Record of the global phase change and will be returned.

    num_ops: int
        Number of Hamiltonians in the processor.

    Attributes
    ----------
    N: int
        The number of the component systems.

    params: dict
        A Python dictionary contains the name and the value of the parameters,
        such as laser frequency, detuning etc.

    num_ops: int
        Number of control Hamiltonians in the processor.

    gate_decomps: dict
        The Python dictionary in the form of {gate_name: decompose_function}.
        It saves the decomposition scheme for each gate.

    setup: string
        "linear" or "circular" for two sub-calsses.

    global_phase: bool
        Record of the global phase change and will be returned.
